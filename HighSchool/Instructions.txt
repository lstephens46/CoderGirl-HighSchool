Complete the High School (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. program that contains a Student class. You must track the student’s first name, last name, grade (1 - 12), and current GPA (1-4). Store a list of 10 or more fake students in a list. Then, use LINQ to print a list of students with a GPA of 3 or higher that are in the 9th - 12th grade. The list should output their first name, last name, grade and GPA. It should be sorted by highest grade, then highest GPA, then last name, then first name.


1. The Student class should have a static method called "StarStudents" which takes a Student list and returns a Student list that
- contains only the students in grades 9-12
- is sorted by highest grade, then highest GPA, then last name, then first name. (edited)

2. The Student class GPA property should have a min value of 0 and max value of 4. If a user of the class tries to set the value of the GPA below/above the min/max, it will be set at the min/max instead.

3. The Student Grade has a min of 1 and a max of 12. If a user of the class tries to set the value of the Grade below/above the min/max, it will be set at the min/max instead.
The rest of the instructions about printing etc. aren't tested and therefore aren't part of the requirements. Its probably a good idea to do so for testing purposes.
